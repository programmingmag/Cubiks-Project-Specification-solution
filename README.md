Overview
We propose to build a Tetris­like timed matching game that has the same feel and style of Tetris
but a completely different purpose. It is a one­player game in which different, randomly
generated patterns of 3×3 matrices of squares fall from the top of the screen. On the right side of
the screen is a single 3×3 matrix of squares. The player has to match the correct matrix falling
from the top of the screen to the one displayed on the right. The player is prompted for a
username at the beginning of the game, and his or her high score is saved to that name. This
game will be made in Unity with the C# language and will be available on the Android mobile
phone platform. Since the Android OS is similar to that of Linux, it will be simple to run on ECC
machines as well.
Screenshot/Mockup
Below is an example of the 3×3 matrix described in the Overview. It was produced using a
random number generator within the constraints of a 2­dimensional array in Unity.
Features and Schedule Table
Below is a table that displays who is in charge of doing what and when. Also displayed is how
much that portion of the project is worth in terms of percentage. The “*” indicates what features
will be able to be presented at the project prototype demonstration on November 30.

Feature Description
1. The first thing we want to get done is the random matrix generator which will generate a
3×3 matrix of squares. The color and assortment of the squares is where the generator
comes in. Once we have this implemented, the overall concept behind our game is done.
2. Next, we want to get a Guided User Interface implemented. This means we want the
game to be able to function and able to be operated with user commands. This means that
we would need 2D art on the screen to symbolize buttons, information, and stats. Simply
the art is all we need for this checkpoint.
3. Once we have GUI, we need it to function. Making the game work with the buttons
we’ve created is essentially what this checkpoint is.
4. After we have our GUI created and functioning properly, we need to be sure that when
the user taps on the right matrix, it detects that this was a correct match. The same goes
for when the user taps on the wrong matrix.
5. The scoring system is the next step. When the player touches the correct matrix, the
system needs to add 100 points to the user’s score.
6. Additionally, we want the user to be able to give him/herself a name. When the user gets
a score that is higher than the original ones, we want that to be stored to that username.
7. Finally, we need to give our game a challenge and a consequence. The timer will act as
both of those things. The user will have a set amount of time to get as many matches as
he or she can correct. We will also be using the period for testing and making sure our
game works on ECC machines.
8. Finally, the second stage of testing will be testing for minor bugs before release.
Sample Input and Output
The drawing above provides a general idea of what the game is going to look like. The user will
simply be prompted for their username when starting the game and will use the left mouse button
to choose which matrix is the correct one.
Running the Application
The user simply has to double click Cubix.exe if on a desktop or click once on the Cubix
application if on the Android mobile device.
